            <h3>The Introduction</h3>
            <p>Systems development is the process of defining, designing, testing, and implementing a new 
                software application or program. Programming is used as a tool for System Development</p>
                <h4>Types of Model</h4>
               <p> There are 3 types of models in the object oriented modelling and design are: </p>
               <ol>
                <li>Class Model </li>
                <li>State Model </li>
                <li>Interaction Model </li>
                </ol>
            
                <h4>Class Model  </h4>
                <p>
                    The class model shows all the classes present in the system. The class model shows the 
                    attributes and the behaviour associated with the objects. </p>
                <p>
                    The class diagram is used to show the class model. The class diagram shows the class name 
                    followed by the attributes followed by the functions or the methods that are associated with 
                    the object of the class. Goal in constructing class model is to capture those concepts from the 
                    real world that are important to an application</p>
                 
                <h4>State Model </h4>
                <p>
                    State model describes those aspects of objects concerned with time and the sequencing of 
                    operations – events that mark changes, states that define the context for events, and the 
                    organization of events and states. Actions and events in a state diagram become operations 
                    on objects in the class model. State diagram describes the state model.</p>
                
                <h4>Interaction Model </h4>
                <p>nteraction model is used to show the various interactions between objects, how the objects 
                    collaborate to achieve the behaviour of the system as a whole.
                </p>
              
            
            <h3>Unified Modelling Language </h3>
            <p>
                UML is a standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting 
                the artifacts of software systems.
                UML was created by the Object Management Group (OMG) and UML 1.0 specification 
                draft was proposed to the OMG in January 1997.OMG is continuously making efforts 
                to create a truly industry standard.
                UML stands for Unified Modelling Language.
                UML is different from the other common programming languages such as C++, Java, 
                COBOL, etc.
                UML is a pictorial language used to make software blueprints.
                UML can be described as a general-purpose visual modelling language to visualize, 
                specify, construct, and document software system. Although UML is generally used to 
                model software systems, it is not limited within this boundary. It is also used to model 
                non-software systems as well. For example, the process flow in a manufacturing unit, 
                etc.
                UML is not a programming language but tools can be used to generate code in various 
                languages using UML diagrams. UML has a direct relation with object-oriented 
                analysis and design. After some standardization, UML has become an OMG standard.

        <h3>Object-Oriented Software Developer</h3>
        <p>The Object-Oriented Software Developer (OOSD) program is designed to provide you with the knowledge and
             practice you need to develop solid software development skills in minimal time.

            OOSD's focus on objects early in the development, with attention to generating a useful model, creates a picture
            of the system that is modifiable, reusable, reliable, and understandable — the last perhaps most important because the picture of a software system created by a
            development method must be an effective device for communication among developers, customers, management, and quality-assurance personnel.</p>
